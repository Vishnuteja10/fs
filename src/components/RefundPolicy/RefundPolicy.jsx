            Thank you for using Fracspace. This Refund Policy outlines the terms
            and conditions under which refunds are provided for the services
            offered on the Fracspace website and mobile application ( "Website"
            and "App"). Please read this policy carefully before making any
            purchases or engaging with our services.

            1. Fractional Ownership: Fracspace offers fractional ownership of
            real estate properties. Once a fractional ownership purchase is
            made, it is considered final. We encourage users to carefully review
            all property details, terms, and conditions before proceeding with a
            purchase

            2. Booking and Reservation Fees: For bookings and reservations made
            through the Fracspace platform, certain fees may be applicable.
            These fees are non-refundable unless explicitly stated otherwise. We
            recommend reviewing the specific terms and conditions related to
            each booking or reservation before confirming your payment.

            3. Cancellation of Services: If Fracspace cancels a confirmed
            booking or reservation due to unforeseen circumstances or any other
            reasons, a full refund will be provided to the user. We will make
            all reasonable efforts to notify affected users in a timely manner
            and process the refund as quickly as possible within 60 days.

            every effort to rectify the situation promptly. If, however, we are
