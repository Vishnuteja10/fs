              I/We acknowledge that I/we have read the Terms and Conditions
              regarding the purchase and usage of FRACSPACEâ€™s Fractional
              Ownership, as well as the Terms and Conditions related to the

              I/We comprehend that any payment I/we make will initially be
              allocated to the Booking Fees, with any remaining balance
              allocated toward the entitlement fees.
            </li>
            <li>
              I/We acknowledge that in case of my/our cancellation request,
              Fracspace reserves the right to deduct cancellation charges as
              outlined in the Terms and Conditions. Only the remaining balance
              will be refunded. The booking amount serves as "Earnest Money" in
              the event of cancellation after payment, Fracspace will forfeit
              10% of the "Earnest Money". However, there is a seven-day free
              look period from the Onboarding date.
            </li>
            <li>
              I/We acknowledge that I/we will become a FRAC Owner of FRACSPACE
              only upon the full realization of the entire amount and the two
              installments of the chosen Payment Plan. This entitles me/us to
              the benefits of FRACSPACE Ownership, including a 6% BROI (Bank
              Rate of Interest) until property possession and a guaranteed
              rental yield of 8% per annum.
            </li>
            <li>
              I/We acknowledge that I/We the Fractional Owner of FRACSPACE may
              choose to exit this agreement at any time with a 60 day notice
              period.{" "}
            </li>
            <li>
              I/We comprehend that in the event of any name transfers or gift,
              it may take up to 7 working days to transfer to be reflected.
            </li>
            <li>
              I/We affirm that SPV shall be formed consequent to all the units
              of a particular property having been sold out.
            </li>
            <li>
              I/We acknowledge that the BROI (Bank Rate of Interest) will be
              applicable only after complete payment is done by the Fractional
              Owner or Shareholder of the property. All documentation will be
              delivered once the entire payment has been completed.
            </li>
            <li>
              I/We comprehend that Fracspace is responsible for property
              maintenance. Hence, I/we recognize that Fracspace will deduct 30%
              from the generated rentals for the property maintenance,
              distributing the remaining 70% among the property shareholders.
              Importantly, this maintenance cost will not impact the guaranteed
              8% return on the investment amount.

          <h3>Cancellation & Refund Policy</h3>

              legally owned cards/accounts. Fracspace does not store users'
              payment details. Failed transactions due to lack of authorization
              or interruptions will not be processed, and erroneous charges will
              be refunded. Users are responsible for fraudulent card use and
              must provide evidence to dispute it; Fracspace is not liable for
              such incidents.{" "}
            </li>
            <li>
              In the event of a transaction failure due to bank authorization
              issues or any interruption, it will be deemed unsuccessful, and no
              orders will proceed. Erroneous charges during failed transactions
              will be refunded. Users are solely responsible for any fraudulent
              card use and must provide evidence to refute it. Fracspace cannot
              be held responsible for such matters.
